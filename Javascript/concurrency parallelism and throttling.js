/*
-->concurrency and parallelism and throttling in js

1) Concurrency:
Concurrency is like juggling multiple balls at once. You can handle different tasks or actions, even if you can only focus on one at a time.

2) Parallelism:
Parallelism is when you have multiple people working on different parts of a big task at the same time. It makes things faster because tasks get done simultaneously.

3) Throttling:
Throttling is like putting a speed limit on something. You control how often a certain action can happen, like how often a function can be called, to avoid overwhelming a system or causing problems.
